## Identifying potential risky locations for San Francisco property crime, 
for the years 2007 and 2019.

The `USF` package has information on historic crime and land use data for San Francisco. 
This assignment would clean up the dataset, and
create a variable for property crime (as defined by to the [National Institute of Justice](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crime/property-crimes)) for both years. 
With that information, you should identify the types of land use that are most risky 
(use fields `property_class_code_definition` for specifics on land use and 
`use_definition` to group by categories). A socioeconomic analysis (census income, 
population data) that goes along with the analysis would add 
context to the areas that appear to be "risky".



## Temporal analysis of crime for San Francisco, years 2007 and 2019

With the `USF` crime data, this project would 
identifying which areas of San Francisco are riskier at what times of the day/season. 
How is 2007 temporal distribution of crime different from 2019?
It could be for property crime or general crime. Perhaps that could be analyzed based on police districts.
A socioeconomic analysis (census income, 
population data) that goes with the temporal analysis would add 
context to the areas that appear to be "risky".
